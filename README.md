# Battleship Coursework 
Course: Programming 2
Semester: 2

This project is the result of my second-semester Prog2 coursework. The task was to test driven develop a simple round based game as a distributed application. 

As my first "bigger" program after being introduced to coding just six months ago, I can say that I was really proud when I successfully completed the task and the game could actually be played together on two machines, 
though it might not follow the standards of clean code and best practices (as I wasn't fully aware of them at that early stage of my studies).
It was this project along with the guidance of my professor that opened my mind for the beauty of coding and showed me that I had choosen the right career.
